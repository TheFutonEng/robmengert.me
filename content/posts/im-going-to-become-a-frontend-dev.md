I started my career as a network engineer on Wall Street, providing network support for high-frequency trading platforms, amongst other things. It was a fun but demanding job, and I learned a ton. From there, I transitioned to a telco and helped design data centers, specifically around the use of load balancers. I dealt with a _lot_ of load balancers.

Later in my tenure at the telco, I got some exposure to Kubernetes, sat for and passed the [CKA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/) and [CKAD](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) certifications, and moved on to a startup defense contractor. In my current role, I’m responsible for training. Our tech stack is heavy on Kubernetes, so I still get exposure to modern software delivery, which won’t change. We’re building a website to host all of the training, and I have found myself completely out of my depth in conversations on frontend development. I decided to lean into my ignorance and push myself to come up to speed on this area of tech.

I’m starting with a tutorial series I found by [Dave Gray](https://courses.davegray.codes/view/courses/web-dev-roadmap-for-beginners) that was suggested by a colleague. While I’m enjoying it so far, I’d love to hear recommendations from anyone reading this. If you have gone on this journey, what worked? What didn’t? Any pointers you could throw at me would be greatly appreciated. I plan on documenting my journey going from “what does HTML stand for again?” to hopefully _kinda_ knowledgeable.
